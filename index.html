              <h3>Paris</h3>
              <p>I would love to visit Paris (also  know as the city of lights) because Paris is one of the most beautiful <br>
                (if not the most) city is the world. Paris have grow from being a small village to be the metropolis <br> that it
                is today. Paris one of the wealthiest region in Europe and contributes around about  30% to France’s
                gross domestic product (GDP). Paris is the center of science, art, fashion and commerce.<br>

          <h3 id="portshead">Portsword Tunnel</h3>
          <p id="portstext">Portswood Tunnel is a historic tunnel that the old builders of 1860 used. The old builders <br>of 1860 of the waterfront had a great problem. They had to quary sttones from the Waterfront to the other side of Portswood Ridge to build the breakwater. So they simply dug out a long cutting, through which gang of sweating convicts pushed cocopans full of stone to whe Query5, past where Ferrymans, Mitchell's brewery and the Amphitheatre are today. Much later the cutting was roofed over and build on, and during the World War II was actually converted - fortunately without ever being needed - for use as an air-raid shelter.</p>

          <h3 id="africanhead">African Trading Port</h3>
          <p id="africantext">At African Trading Port (ATP) we have attempted to bring Africa under one roof. Artwork from practically each African country and culture is available. ATP’s roots started with the establishment of an
             art workshop in Zimbabwe in 1978. We have been housed in our current location; the Old Port Captain’s Building at Cape Town’s Waterfront since 2001.
             ATP employs 60 permanent staff and 500 “art-scouts” who travel specific regions of Africa, going deep into the rural areas and working directly with local communities to collect available artworks.</p>
