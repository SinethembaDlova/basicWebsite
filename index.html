              <h3>Paris</h3>
              <p>I would love to visit Paris (also  know as the city of lights) because Paris is one of the most beautiful <br>
                (if not the best) city is the world. Paris have grow from being a small village to be the metropolis <br> that it
                is today. Paris one of the wealthiest region in Europe and contributes around about  30% to Franceâ€™s
                gross domestic product (GDP). Paris is the center of science, art, fashion and commerce.<br>
                I would love to take a close up look at the Eiffel Tower.</p>
